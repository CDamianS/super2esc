#+title: super2esc

Transforming a useful key into the most useful one.
For vi/Vim/NeoVim/Emacs addicts, keyboard enthusiasts, and anyone who loves custom key mappings.

** What is it?
super2esc is a fork of the caps2esc project, designed to remap the Super (Meta) key to Escape or Control,
enhancing key mapping flexibility.

It's especially useful for chromebook or chultrabooks,
where the Escape or Control keys might not be as easily accessible.

** Why?!
Because the Super key in some keyboards (chromebooks) gets in the way a lot of the time

** Building
To build super2esc, you'll need a Linux system with clang and make.

#+begin_src bash
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/super2esc.git
$ cd super2esc
$ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ cmake --build build
#+end_Src

** Execution
#+begin_src bash
super2esc - transforming a useful key into the most useful one

usage: super2esc [-h | [-m mode] [-t delay]]

options:
    -h        show this message and exit
    -t        delay used for key sequences (default: 20000 microseconds)
    -m mode   0: default
                 - super as esc/ctrl
                 - esc as super
              1: minimal
                 - super as esc/ctrl
              2: useful on 60% layouts
                 - super as esc/ctrl
                 - esc as grave accent
                 - grave accent as super
#+end_Src

super2esc is an Interception Tools plugin. A suggested udevmon job configuration is:
(Check the interception tools README for alternatives)

#+begin_src bash
- JOB: intercept -g $DEVNODE | super2esc | uinput -d $DEVNODE
  DEVICE:
    EVENTS:
      EV_KEY: [KEY_LEFTMETA, KEY_ESC]
#+end_src

** Mouse/Touchpad Support
After Interception Tools 0.3.2, super2esc can observe (or replace) mouse events. An example configuration:
#+begin_src
SHELL: [zsh, -c]
---
- CMD: mux -c super2esc
- JOB: mux -i super2esc | super2esc | uinput -c /etc/interception/keyboard.yaml
- JOB: intercept -g $DEVNODE | mux -o super2esc
  DEVICE:
    LINK: /dev/input/by-path/platform-i8042-serio-0-event-kbd
- JOB: intercept $DEVNODE | mux -o super2esc
  DEVICE:
    LINK: /dev/input/by-path/platform-i8042-serio-4-event-mouse
For more information, check the Interception Tools documentation on using the mux tool and hybrid virtual device configurations.

** About this fork
super2esc is a fork of the caps2esc project, originally created by Francisco Lopes da Silva.
The core ideaâ€”remapping the Caps Lock key to Escape and Control
has been expanded upon here to work with the Super (Meta)
key for basic chromebook keyboard support
